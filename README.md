# Playlist Producer

## Description

The Playlist Producer application is designed to use the Napster API to generate a list of musical artists, compiled into playlists, based on mood input selections. This application was built with HTML, CSS Foundation, JavaScript, and the JQueryUI API. <br>

This was a week-long project built during the first month of Northwestern Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. Project goals included: using at least two third-party APIâ€™s, to use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap, and use client-side storage to store persistent data. Over the week, we worked to create an interactive and responsive front-end application with a polished UI.
